# 🐍 Snake Game (Vanilla JavaScript)

A classic Snake Game built using **Vanilla JavaScript**, HTML, and CSS.  
This project focuses on **learning JavaScript by building**, helping to clear core logic concepts such as game loops, collision detection, state management, and DOM manipulation.

---

##  Purpose of the Project

This project was created as a **learning exercise** to strengthen JavaScript fundamentals by implementing a real-world interactive application.

Building this game helped in understanding:
- How game logic works step-by-step
- How to manage state without frameworks
- How to debug and fix logical edge cases
- How JavaScript interacts with the DOM in real time

---

##  Key Concepts Learned

- **DOM Manipulation**
- **Event Handling (Keyboard Controls)**
- **Game Loop using `setInterval`**
- **Collision Detection**
  - Wall collision
  - Self-bite collision
- **State Management**
  - Snake body tracking
  - Direction control
  - Food spawning logic
- **Edge Case Handling**
  - Preventing reverse direction
  - Avoiding food spawn on snake body
- **Local Storage**
  - High score persistence
- **Code Structuring & Debugging**

---

## Game Features

- Classic Snake movement (W / A / S / D)
- Snake grows on eating food
- Game over on:
  - Wall collision
  - Self-bite
- Score tracking
- High score saved using `localStorage`
- Timer display
- Restart functionality
- Snake head highlighted with a different color

---

##  Tech Stack

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Vanilla JavaScript (No frameworks)**

---

##  Why This Project Matters

This project is not just about the game — it is about **learning how to think logically as a JavaScript developer**.

Many common beginner issues were solved here, such as:
- Incorrect collision checks
- Improper array handling
- DOM vs data logic confusion
- Game state synchronization

Completing this project significantly improved confidence in writing **bug-free JavaScript logic**.
